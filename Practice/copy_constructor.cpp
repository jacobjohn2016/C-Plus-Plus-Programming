/*
 * The copy constructor is a constructor which creates an object by initializing 
 * it with an object of the same class, which has been created previously. 
 * The copy constructor is used to âˆ’
 * 1. Initialize one object from another of the same type.
 * 2. Copy an object to pass it as an argument to a function.
 * 3. Copy an object to return it from a function.
 * If a copy constructor is not defined in a class, the compiler itself defines one.
 * If the class has pointer variables and has some dynamic memory allocations, then 
 * it is a must to have a copy constructor.
