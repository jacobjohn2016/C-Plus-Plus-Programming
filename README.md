## [Leaders of Elements](https://github.com/jacobjohn2016/C-Plus-Plus-Programming/blob/master/leaders_of_elements.cpp)
Given a set of 'n' elements in an order, identify all the leaders and print them. An element is said to be a leader if all the elements to its right are smaller than it. For example, if the elements are 12, 13, 16, 7, 10 then there is only one leader element 16. If there are no leaders in the given set of elements then print 'No leaders'.

## [Cyclic Right Shift of Elements](https://github.com/jacobjohn2016/C-Plus-Plus-Programming/blob/master/cyclic_right_shift.cpp)
Given a set of elements stored in an array and a number 'm', design an Algorithm and write the subsequent C program to perform cyclic right shift of the array by 'm' places. For example, if the elements are 12, 13, 16, 7, 10 and m = 2 then the resultant set will be 7, 10, 12, 13, 16.

## [Second Smallest Number](https://github.com/jacobjohn2016/C-Plus-Plus-Programming/blob/master/second_smallest.cpp)
Given a set of elements, design an Algorithm and write the subsequent C program to determine the second smallest number in that set.

## [Recursive Fibonacci](https://github.com/jacobjohn2016/C-Plus-Plus-Programming/blob/master/fibonacci.cpp)
Given the value of 'n', write a recursive routine in C to print the first 'n' elements of the Fibonacci series. Fibonacci series is obtained by the sum of the preceding two terms in the series. The first two terms are 0 and 1.

## [Recursive reverse](https://github.com/jacobjohn2016/C-Plus-Plus-Programming/blob/master/string_reverse.cpp)
Given a string, write a recursive routine to reverse it. For example, given the string 'and, the reversal of the string is 'dna'.
